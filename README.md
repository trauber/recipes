Food recipes for rendering with kde kookbook. This option seems too simple to pass up.

Well... I just can't seem to get kookbook to work on my machine. Bummer...

[recipemd](http://recipemd.org), a plain text recipe parser in python, looks promising. One **really** nice feature is the quantity multiplier. And then there are the search and extraction utilities.
