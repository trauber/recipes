A North African dish which has become popular in the Mideast, Europe, and elsewhere in the West, especially during the 2010s. This dish is very simple and satisfying.

- *1* pepper
- *1* onion

Saute pepper and onion with olive oil in a medium pan. Add diced tomatoes. Cover and let cook on low for 10 minutes. Place each egg in a well in the sauce. Cover and let eggs poach to desired consistency. Garnish with parsley or cilantro.

I spice the sauce and the eggs with [Harissa rub](harissa-rub.md).


Serve with bread for sopping up the sauce.
