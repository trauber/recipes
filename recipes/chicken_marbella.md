**5 serving(s)**

---

- *1* 4- to 5-pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- *1/2 cup* olive oil
- *1/2 cup* balsamic vinegar
- *1/2 cup* pitted dates, quartered
- *1/2 cup* pitted Cerignola olives, halved
- *1/4 cup* capers with brine
- *1/4 cup* chopped fresh Italian parsley
- *1 tablespoon* dried oregano
- *8 cloves* garlic, peeled and finely pureed or grated
- *2* bay leaves
- *2 tablespoons* light brown sugar
- *1/2 cup* white wine

---

Arrange the chicken in a large baking dish and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Combine the olive oil, vinegar, dates, olives, capers with their brine, parsley, oregano, garlic and bay leaves in a large bowl. Pour the mixture evenly over the chicken. Flip and rotate the chicken to coat it completely. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

When you are ready to cook the chicken, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Let the chicken sit at room temperature while the oven preheats.

Arrange the chicken pieces so that they are all skin-side up. Spoon the marinade from the bottom of the dish over the chicken. Sprinkle the chicken with the brown sugar. Pour the wine around the chicken. Bake, basting every 10 to 15 minutes with the pan juices, until the chicken is brown on top, the juices run clear when pierced and the internal temperature is 165 degrees F, 50 to 60 minutes. Baste the chicken with its juices, then transfer it to a large platter. Spoon the olives, capers and dates over the chicken with a slotted spoon, only including a little of the sauce. Serve the remaining sauce on the side, if desired.
