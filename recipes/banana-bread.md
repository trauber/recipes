# Banana Bread

When bananas turn black, I often whirl them in the blender, pack in 1-cup batches in heavy-duty plastic bags, and freeze. I thaw the fruit in the bag, in a bowl of warm water.

*breakfast, dessert, banana*

**1 loaf**

---

- *1/2 cup* butter, at room temperature
- *1 cup* sugar
- *2* eggs
- *1 cup* mashed ripe bananas
- *2 cups* all-purpose flour
- *1 teaspoon* baking powder
- *1/2 teaspoon* baking soda
- *1/2 teaspoon* salt
- *1/2 cup* chopped walnuts

---

Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease and flour one 9 1/2 x 5 1/2 inch loaf pan or three 5 3/4 x 3 1/2 inch loaf pans.

In a large mising bowl, cream the butter and sugar until well blended. Beat in the eggs and mashed banana. In a small bowl combine the flour, baking powder, soda, and salt and blend into the creamed mixture. Stir in the nuts. Turn into the prepared pan or pans. Bake 1 hour and 10 minutes for the large loaf or 45 to 55 minutes for the smaller loaves, or until they are done. Cool in the pan 5 minutes, then remove to a rack and finish cooling.
