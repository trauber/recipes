# Baba Ghanoush

Delicious eggplant dip. I make a small batch in a bowl with an immersion blender.

*dip, eggplant*

---

- *1* eggplant
- *1 tablespoon* plain yogurt
- *1 tablespoon* olive oil
- *1* lemon
- *1 tablespoon* tahini
- *2 cloves* garlic

---

- Roast eggplant and remove skin.
- In medium bowl blend well olive oil, lemon juice, yogurt, tahini, thinly sliced garlic.
- Add eggplant and blend, but not too much. You want to have nice little chunks of eggplant.
